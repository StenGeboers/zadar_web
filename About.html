        Zadar has a long history and they weren't always Croatian but also they where Roman,Byzatine,Venetian,Hungarian,French,Austrian and Italian. The city has been known a long time under his Italian name "Zara". After the peace of Campo Formio(1797) the city came under the control of th Empire of Austria just like the rest of Croatia. From 1806 it came under the control of the Kingdom of Italy and later again of the Illyrian provinces that were held by Napoleon Bonaparte. After 1813 the city came under Austrian control again and it became the capital of the dependent Kingdom of Dalmatia.<br>However the city had a large Italian population and in the course of the 19th century, the call for joining Italy caused a lot of tension in the city. In 1920 it was so far. In the Treaty of Rapallo was determined that the city along with several islands would be granted to Italy. After the second World War, in wich the city was bombed, the italian inhabitants fled to Italy and in 1947 Zadar became a part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.<br>
        In 1991 anti-Serb riots broke out in the city and during the Croatian war of independence, Zadar repeadly was under fire. Since 2002, the city has a University.
